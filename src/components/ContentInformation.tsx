          <p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source that comes from the sun and can be harnessed in several ways. There are two main technologies for capturing it:

          Photovoltaic solar energy: Uses solar panels to convert sunlight into electricity. Ideal for homes, businesses and large solar parks.
          Solar thermal energy: It is used to heat water or generate electricity using mirrors that concentrate sunlight on one point.

          In Colombia, the use of solar energy has grown due to reduced costs and abundant solar radiation.</p>
